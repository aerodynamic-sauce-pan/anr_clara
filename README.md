# Tree detection

## DarkNet
*DarkNet* is an open source neural network used for object detection, and backbone of the *YOLO* networks. The executable file for detection, `darknet.exe`, in located in `darknet-master\build\darknet\x64`. You should run it from console. 
- The network's weights trained on real forest images is located in `darknet-master\build\darknet\x64\backup`.
- The network's weights trained on the synthetic dataset locates in `darknet-master\build\darknet\x64\backup2`.

## DenseDepth
*DenseDepth* is a depth estimation network based on keras. The model used for training on the syhthetic dataset is uploaded in Releases. 
The test script file `test.py` is located in `DenseDepth-master`.

## AdapNet
*AdapNet* is a semantic segmentation network based on Tensorflow which uses *ResNet50* as backbone. The model used for training on the syhthetic dataset is uploaded in Releases
in the following directory : `init_checkpoint\synthia_rgb`. The test file `evaluate.py` is located in `AdapNet-pp-master/`. The test result is in `AdapNet-pp-master\images\test_synthetic`.
*AdapNet* is easily trainable on a single 12GB memory GPU card and has a fast inference time.

# Quality of code
## Linters
In order to guarantee quality of code approaching PEP8 and PEP257 requirements, popular linters (listed in the following sections) are used. To simplify their usage, a script named `checkMyCode.sh` and located in the project root folder has been created.

##### Configuration & usage
The available options for `checkMyCode.sh` are listed in its first `case in`. In a future version of the script, this help page could be included in it and made accessible via a `--help` argument.

The script runs the **linters** over any `.py` file located in the `src/` directory as well as all its sub-directories, and which name is different from `__init__.py`.

The script runs the **testers** over any `.py` file located in the `tests/` directory as well as all its sub-directories, and which name is different from `__init__.py`.

- Run all linters and testers:
```bash
./checkMyCode.sh all
```

- Run testers only :
```bash
./checkMyCode.sh t
```

- Run linters only :
```bash
./checkMyCode.sh [l]
```

- Run only linters or only testers on a specific file or directory (depending on its location) :
```bash
./checkMyCode.sh <FILE_OR_DIRECTORY>
```

## Linters
Linters are static code analysis tools used to flag programming errors, bugs, stylistic errors, and suspicious constructs. In doing so, they help to ensure the good quality of code. Furthemore, the 3 linters used in this project and listed in the following sections, help approaching the PEP8 and PEP257 norms with a few exceptions.

The following rules were ignored/modified/added so as to avoid excessive constraints :

- The max line length has been increased to 81
- The max complexity of Flake8 has been increased to 12 so as to match Pylint's default configuration
- The following Pydocstyle errors have been ignord : D107, D203, D204, D213, D407, D406, D413

#### Flake8
Flake8 is a python wrapper around PyFlakes, Pydocstyle and Ned Batchelderâ€™s McCabe script, used to verify the code and pick up on styling deviations from the PEP8 norm, programatic errors (_e.g._ unused imports) and conduct complexity checks.

Flake8 is complementary to Pylint.

##### Configuration & usage
The Flake8 config file `tox.ini` is shared with other linters and is located at the project root directory.

- Run flake8 :
```bash
flake8 [<FILE_OR_DIRECTORY>]
```

#### Pylint
Pylint is a quality checker for Python picking up on styling deviations from the PEP8 norm, code duplication, bugs... It also suggests alternatives to the code structure.

##### Configuration & usage
The Pylint config file `pylintrc` is located at the project root directory.

- Run pylint :
```bash
pylint [<FILE_OR_DIRECTORY>]
```

#### Pydocstyle
Pydocstyle is a static analysis tool for checking compliance with Python docstring conventions. Pydocstyle supports most of PEP 257 out of the box, but it should not be considered a reference implementation.

##### Configuration & usage
The Pydocstyle config file `tox.ini` is shared with other linters and is located at the project root directory.

- Run pydocstyle :
```bash
pydocstyle [<FILE_OR_DIRECTORY>]
```
